  I was raised in the small town of Franklin, Maine. I went through the Ellsworth school system where I played softball, basketball, and volleyball.When I was a sophomore in high school I had to stop playing all sports due to a condition in my knee called Osteochondritis dissecans. I never played on a sports team again. Yeah, it sucked. I have been taking college classes on and off since graduating from high school, never really knowing what career I wanted to pursue. In 2013 I met John. We had our son Griffin January 2nd of 2017. He proposed November 9th of 2017. Which brings us to today. I'm currently in college for Finance. In the past year alone I have changed my major 4 times which is a little ridiculous. I am still unsure if Finance is even the career for me. I feel so strongly about the education system in America and it's need for improvement that switching my major again is likely to happen in the future. *Sidenote* It's weird being the oldest student in most of my classes, that's new for me now that I'm enrolled at this college!
