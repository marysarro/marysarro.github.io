	<font size="4" color="white">I should leave this page completely blank as a metaphor for me having absolutely no idea what is in store for my future, but I will try to at least make some guesses. My fiance, who will actually be my husband in just a few days, is deploying to Afghanistan in April. So, while he is away for a year, my son and I are going to do a lot of hanging out! That's the near future... The distant future, I hope to have made, or be in the process of making some sort of difference. Whether that be as a mother, as a finance person (BLAH), or maybe in the school department, I really don't know yet. We'll have to wait and see!
